When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
We would want to use a remote repository to
1. Create a cloud based, web accessible copy to use anywhere
2. To share our projects with others
3. To work jointly on a project with collaborators off site.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that we pull/ push only meaningful changes and not create a lot of almost identical 
files, making it difficult to track logical updates.
