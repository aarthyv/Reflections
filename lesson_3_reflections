When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
We would want to use a remote repository to
1. Create a cloud based, web accessible copy to use anywhere
2. To share our projects with others
3. To work jointly on a project with collaborators off site.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that we pull/ push only meaningful changes and not create a lot of almost identical 
files, making it difficult to track logical updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Forks - Copy repository within git hub, to copy a project to our git hub account and then
change it without affecting the original, also acknowledges the original creator of the
repository.
Clones- Copies the entire history of a repository either between github and local working
directory or within the working directory. All commits are copied.
Branches- Creates a sub- file of the same folder/ project either locally or on git hub.
We would use fork to copy another person's files to our account on github, branch to 
create a copy that we want to work on so as to not alter the master copy and clone to copy
all the data and history of a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps us track and sync the remite and local versions so that any changes in future 
are in sync and incorporated into the working directory.
